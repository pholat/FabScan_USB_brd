Driver board made for fabscan v0.1, fully tested - version mini.
→ Project in kicad will be added. Now it demands some cosmetic changes (not concerning functionality though)
→ There is version for 3 stepsticks, PWM lights and so one too, to be tested yet :)

How to:
→ Diy mask is file for termotransfer of the board. It's size is 5x5 cm.
→ It's needed to connect both vias - as it connect ground.
→ Remember to flash your attiny2313 before solidering here - it's pain in the ( . ) to solder SPI cables on this board, trust me, I tried it.
→ File to flash is in code\Release

Enjoy!

ps. Windows users shall pass through rite of passage know as Windows drivers hell, sorry I never been there - I can't help.
